Similarly, for \"World Cup\" we'd have [\"World\" (B-MISC), \"Cup\" (I-MISC)]. If an entity only has one token, then its entity tag would still have prefix \"B-\".

This process is commonly referred to as **decoding**. Bigram-based Viterbi is $ \\mathcal{O}(sm^2)$ where *s* is the length of the sentence and *m* is the number of tags.

This ensures that words with low occurrence are not treated as unique and distinct, allowing the model to recognize them as a common unknown category. By doing so, the method helps the model maintain consistent performance when dealing with unfamiliar or rare words, enhancing its ability to handle unseen data effectively.\n",

This process is commonly referred to as **decoding**. Bigram-based Viterbi is $ \\mathcal{O}(sm^2)$ where *s* is the length of the sentence and *m* is the number of tags. Your implementation should have similar efficiency. The code for this can be used later on for the MEMM too.\n",

This ensures that words with low occurrence are not treated as unique and distinct, allowing the model to recognize them as a common unknown category. By doing so, the method helps the model maintain consistent performance when dealing with unfamiliar or rare words, enhancing its ability to handle unseen data effectively.\n",

However, it seemed to struggle with longer proper nouns (ex: Martin van der Sar, Copenhagen metropolitan area). It makes sense that the MEMM was able to easily learn how to predict locations and two word names as they are probably the two most common proper nouns, so the MEMM had a lot of data to learn on. It also makes sense that it struggled with longer proper nouns: these ners are probably more uncommon, and the mix of capitalization and lowercase probably confused it for both of the examples given. A possible fix would be to find the difference between the nearest capital words, as they are still relatively close in terms of sentence indexing."
