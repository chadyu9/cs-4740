This task is known as **Named Entity Recognition**.\n","\n","We will treat this as a **sequence-tagging task**: for each token in the input text, assign one of the following 5 entities -- **ORG** (Organization), **PER** (Person), **LOC** (Location), **MISC** (Miscellaneous), and **O** (Not Named Entity)) -- as well as a BIO-format prefix **B-** (token is the *beginning* of a named entity) or **I-** (token is *inside* a named entity). Thus, overall this makes 9 different labels: **B-ORG, I-ORG, B-PER, I-PER, B-LOC, I-LOC, B-MISC, I-MISC** and **O**.\n","\n","To refresh your memory on HMMs, MEMMs, and Viterbi you can refer to **Jurafsky & Martin Ch. 8.3â€“8.5** and the lecture slides which can be found on the course website.\n","\n","<u>Authors:</u> Benjamin Hu, Gavin Fogel, Sienna Hu, Vivian Chen, Vivian Nguyen <br>\n","<u>Acknowledgments:</u> We drew inspiration and the code from previous efforts by CS 4740/5740 professors and TAs from this and previous semesters, Chenxin Fang, Meghana Srivastava, Khonzoda Umarova, Ruizhe Wang, Han Xia, and Heather Zhang."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"j4HEGAUqwyos"},"source":["## **Logistics**\n","\n","\n","- You are **strongly encouraged** to work in **groups of 2 students**.

You can make a post on EdStem to find a partner for this project.\n","- Please complete the written questions in a separate file that will be submitted as a pdf.\n","- In this assignment you are asked to make two submissions:\n","  1. The **final homework submission due on September 20 (11:59 PM)**.\n","      - For this, please make sure to submit a zip file named `final_submission.zip` containing the following files:\n","        - `models.py`, `helpers.py`, `data_exploration.py`, `viterbi.py`, `validation.py` (5 python source files)\n","\t\t\t- There is a script you can run locally before submitting your python files, `check_submission.py`. This will check the cwd for the required zip specified above, and check its contents to make sure you have all of the required python files with your names and net ids, and all of the required functions and classes.

This section provides a brief introduction to the task and why it is important.\n","\n","**What is NER?**\n","NER refers to the information extraction technique of identifying and categorizing key information about entities within textual data. Let's look at an example:\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","![picture](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mxwn1_2Ef16_MJeyl9jJwwR6IohUOeHO)\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","In the above example, we can see that the text has numerous named entities that can be categorized as LOC (location), ORG (organization), PER (person), or MISC (miscellaneous). In our dataset named entity tags are formatted in BIO/IOB format. With this format, entity tags get a prefix. Prefix \"B-\" is added to the first word/token of the entity name. All following tokens that are part of the same entity name would get prefix \"I-\". For instance, in the example above, entity \"Renate Goetschl\" gets [\"Renate\" (B-PER), \"Goestchl\" (I-PER)]. Similarly, for \"World Cup\" we'd have [\"World\" (B-MISC), \"Cup\" (I-MISC)]. If an entity only has one token, then its entity tag would still have prefix \"B-\". O is used to denote tokens that are not part of any named entity. Thus, from the example above, we'd have:\n","\n","`[\"ZIFA\" (B-ORG), \"said\" (O), \"Renate\" (B-PER), \"Goetschl\" (I-PER), \"of\" (O), \"Austria\" (B-LOC), \"won\" (O), \"the\" (O), \"women's\" (O), \"World\" (B-MISC), \"Cup\" (I-MISC), \"downhill\" (O), \"race\" (O), \"in\" (O), \"Germany\" (B-LOC)]`\n","\n","\n","Today, the task of NER has been overwhelmed by deep learning approaches. However, for this assignment, we will try to do NER using something simpler: HMMs and MEMMs. NER is important for a number of reasons and has a wide variety of use cases such as but not limited to:\n","  - Detecting entities in search engines and voice assistants for more relavent search results.\n","  - Automatically parsing resumes.\n","  - ...and many more!\n","\n","\n","To read more on NER, we refer to any of the following sources:\n","1.
