First, PyTorch is very \"pythonic\" and easy-to-learn compared to some other machine learning frameworks.

Third, there are a number of behind-the-scenes operations that occur (namely, dynamic computation graphing) which helps us optimize our models and their training.\n","\n","For more information on key features of PyTorch, please consider the following links:\n","\n","1.

My \"2\" is not the same as your \"2\", which is different than both Marty's and Lillian's \"2\"s. It is also extremely likely that each \"2: I write is (at least) minorly different in appearance. However, our brains have identified the general, abstract image of what a \"2\" looks like -- \"half a heart, with a line at the bottom going to the right\" (or something like that) -- but such a conceptual representation can be realized as an image in infinite different ways. As such, our model is trying to \"learn\" this abstract form from the data, meaning it needs to discover some complex representation of pixels that identifies a \"2\" from an \"8\". With each pass through the data, the model becomes better and better at identifying the complex patterns that lead it to the abstract \"2\" class.\n","\n","Second, the learning rate (here, lr = 0.003) determines how much the model can update at one point in time; learning rates are often between 0.01 and 0.001. The value of this learning rate matters quite a bit. If the learning rate is too high, the model will drastically change its parameters with each pass of the data, reducing the likelihood of model convergence because it cannot maintain its predictions. If the learning rate is too low, the model will make changes to its parameters that are too tiny, also reducing the likelihood that your model will converge, but for a different reason -- it may not reach the ideal local minima."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LsmqKU_5aw2-"},"source":["Note that our training loss goes down after each epoch -- this is good news!

My \"2\" is not the same as your \"2\", which is different than both Marty's and Lillian's \"2\"s. It is also extremely likely that each \"2: I write is (at least) minorly different in appearance. However, our brains have identified the general, abstract image of what a \"2\" looks like -- \"half a heart, with a line at the bottom going to the right\" (or something like that) -- but such a conceptual representation can be realized as an image in infinite different ways. As such, our model is trying to \"learn\" this abstract form from the data, meaning it needs to discover some complex representation of pixels that identifies a \"2\" from an \"8\". With each pass through the data, the model becomes better and better at identifying the complex patterns that lead it to the abstract \"2\" class.\n","\n","Second, we are controlling how much the model can update at once."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"S8A_Kjex3sfy"},"source":["To perform additional test analyses (model perplexity, etc.), you can pass the entire test data through the model without updating any parameters or performing backpropagation and keep track of the total loss.
