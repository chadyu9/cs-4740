Some important points (instructions) to note:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item This part of the homework assignment is an \textit{individual} 
    component (not to be done in teams), and is only relevant to students 
    enrolled in CS~5740, i.e., the graduate listing of the course.
    \item Ensure that your name and net ID are included in the .pdf file 
    submitted to us.
    \item Since GitHub does not render a relevant diff for .pdf files, the 
    corresponding diff (wherever applicable) will be timestamped and marked 
    inline, in \textcolor{orange}{orange} text.
    \item Please read the associated material (you may skip the ``supplemental 
    material'' and ``further reading'' portions, when present) in its entirety 
    before answering the questions.
    \item Please be concise when answering the questions; these questions are 
    not meant to be an unordered collection of all your thoughts about the 
    topic. Make compelling, scientifically-backed arguments that aren't 
    misleading or confusing.
    \item Applicable only to \LaTeX~users: if you wish to typeset your answers 
    in \LaTeX, you can use the \texttt{{\textbackslash}answer\{\}} macro in 
    \texttt{pages/questions.tex} to set your answers; the name and net ID can 
    be set in \texttt{main.tex} file using 
    \texttt{{\textbackslash}def{\textbackslash}name\{\}} and 
    \texttt{{\textbackslash}def{\textbackslash}netid\{\}}.
\end{enumerate}
