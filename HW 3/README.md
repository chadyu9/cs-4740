# CS 4740 Fa'23 HW3

Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) using LSTMs and Encoder-Decoder architectures. 

---

## Installation

### Google Colab

You are required to use Google Colab to run this assignment, as you will need to use Colab GPUs to be 
able to train your models in an efficient manner. You will need a personal access token to be able
to `git clone` the assignment; you should have already done this for HW2 (the personal access token is stored for any 
future use in `/content/drive/MyDrive/CS4740/environment_variables.sh`), but in case you are running into issues,
instructions on how to create a personal access token can be seen at
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens.
Note: when you select the scope of your token, you can choose the "repo" scope.

Once you've secured your personal access token, to be able to setup this assignment package (with git functionality),
download the `setup.ipynb` notebook file from:
https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cs4740-fa23-public/hw3-fa23/blob/main/notebooks/setup.ipynb. Upload it to your drive (the
upload location of this file on your drive is insignificant) and open it in Google Colab. Follow the instructions in
the `setup.ipynb`.

Once you have successfully cloned the package to your Google Drive under `/content/drive/MyDrive/CS4740` path, you can
proceed to run: https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/cs4740-fa23-public/hw3-fa23/blob/main/notebooks/Student_CS_4740_FA23_HW3.ipynb. The file should be
located at `/content/drive/MyDrive/CS4740/hw3-fa23/notebooks/notebooks/Student_CS_4740_FA23_HW3.ipynb`.
