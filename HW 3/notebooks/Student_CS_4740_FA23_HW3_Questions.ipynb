    "For all the questions below, we would like to make it known that we expect your answers to be in the form of generics, not the specific numerical dimensions you have tuned your models to possess. Express your answers in terms of h: hidden dimension size, v: vocab size, e: embedding size, o: output dimension size, b: batch size and s: sentence length.\n",

    "It **is** valid, and sometimes expected, to express the generics in terms of a dimension multiplied by a constant e.g. write something such as `(2*e, 5*b)` (this is just an example no tensor in the model actually has this dimension), however all dimensions should only be expressed in terms of dimensional variables and constants. Any answer that only give specific numerical dimensions will not be given credit.\n",

    "If you choose this option, you will need to further break down the quantitative statistics you reported initially. We provide some initial strategies to prime you for what you should think about in doing this. One possible starting point is to consider: if model $X$ achieves greater accuracy than model $Y$, to what extent is $X$ getting everything correct that $Y$ gets correct? For example, what's model's performance on each semantic role types?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. _Nuanced qualitative analysis_ \\\n",
    "If you choose this option, you will need to select individual examples and try to explain or reason about why one model may be getting them right whereas the other isnâ€™t. Are there any examples that both models get right or wrong and, if so, can you hypothesize a reason why this occurs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The report should be written keeping both of the models in mind, discussing and comparing both of their performances, as well as doing the nuanced analysis with both of the models. Due to this, we won't be setting a hard limit on length of the report, but your report should be a substantial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CLARIFICATION:** Whichever option you take, we expect the following (at a minimum):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A minimum of 3 clearly stated examples (for qualitative analysis) or statistics (for your quantitative analysis)\n",
    "2. An explanation as to why you think the phenomena you observed or talked about above is occurring.\n",
    "3. A discussion as to what conclusions you can draw about your models, particularly in comparison with each other, as a result of these examples or statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be clear with your responses, as we will grade according to the presence of the above.\n"
